I'm thinking about measurement. When measurement is irrelevant?

Think it like that:

Does measurement come from natute? Does nature measure?

Just right that:

Advertising used to make 20 seconods videos long. 

How long is an ad? Does advertising come from natute? Is an ad able to be measured?

Think it like that:

I mean, while 

      If we are developing apps so that we can figure out how long we were on there (anywhere):
            Now like this
            Else Just right that
            Break
      
      If we are developing apps so that we can figure out where the sea level mark were (wherever):
            Now like this
      
      else
      If we are developing apps so that we can figure out what kind of measurement we are using (blueprint):
            break
